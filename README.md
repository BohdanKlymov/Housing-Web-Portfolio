## About Me

Starting in summer 2026, I will begin my vocational training as a **Software Developer (Fachinformatiker für Anwendungsentwicklung)** at **symmedia GmbH** in Bielefeld, Germany.

This website was created to:

- Introduce myself beyond a standard rental application  
- Present my background, career path, and documents in a clear and structured way  
- Offer landlords a modern, transparent, and trustworthy overview of me as a future tenant  

The goal is to support long-term rental decisions by providing openness, reliability, and easy access to relevant information.
