<section id="about" class="anchor">
  <h2>Welcome to my portfolio website</h2>

  <p>
    My name is <strong>Bohdan Klymov</strong> and I created this website to give
    potential landlords a transparent and personal insight into who I am —
    both as a person and as a future tenant.
  </p>

  <p>
    I will begin my vocational training as a <strong>Software Developer
    (Fachinformatiker für Anwendungsentwicklung)</strong> in summer 2026 at
    symmedia GmbH in Bielefeld. For this reason, I am currently looking for
    suitable accommodation in the city.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website goes beyond a traditional application. It allows you to
    learn more about my background, values, education and motivation in a
    structured and modern way.

  <h2>About me as a tenant</h2>

  <p>
    I am a calm, reliable and respectful person who values a clean and
    well-maintained living environment. Order and cleanliness are very
    important to me, and I treat any apartment as if it were my own.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am a non-smoker, do not own pets and prefer a quiet lifestyle. A
    respectful relationship with neighbors and careful handling of shared
    spaces are a matter of course for me.
  </p>

  <p>
    During my vocational training, I will have secured financial support,
    ensuring that rent payments are made reliably and on time.

  <h2>Career & Education</h2>

  <p>
    My interest in technology and programming developed at an early stage.
    I enjoy logical thinking, structured problem-solving and continuously
    learning new skills.
  </p>

  <p>
    In summer 2026, I will start my apprenticeship as a software developer
    specializing in application development at symmedia GmbH in Bielefeld.
    The training program lasts three years and combines practical experience
    with theoretical education.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to school and training, I actively educate myself through
    books, online courses and personal programming projects, especially in
    Python and web development.
